# Security audit

**Modes**
- `quick`: only what this branch changed. Scanners on the changed files, `/security-review`,
  the sweep limited to the touched code.
- `full` (default): the whole repository, every phase below.
- `deep`: `full`, plus one read-only subagent per sweep group running in parallel, and a fresh
  subagent trying to disprove each high or critical finding.

**Rules for the whole audit**
- Read code; don't guess. Every finding cites `file:line` and a concrete way to exploit or
  trigger it. "Could be risky" with no path to harm is not a finding.
- Never print a secret's value. Redact it.
- Change nothing until the report is done and the user chooses what to fix.

## 1. Map the attack surface

Write a short map before hunting:
- **Entry points:** HTTP routes and their auth requirement, CLI commands, queue and webhook
  consumers, scheduled jobs, file uploads, and LLM prompts that take user text.
- **Trust boundaries:** where data crosses from the internet, users, third parties or other
  services into the code.
- **Identity:** how authentication works (sessions, JWT, OAuth, API keys), and where
  authorization is enforced: per route, per record, per role.
- **Assets:** stored data (PII, money, credentials), secrets and where they are loaded from,
  and outbound calls (payments, email, cloud APIs).
- **Infrastructure:** Dockerfiles, IaC, CI/CD workflows, the deployed environments.

## 2. Run the scanners

Run `bash .specify/extensions/jit/scripts/security-scan.sh` (add `--changed` in `quick` mode).
- For each `missing` tool, list its install line once at the end. Missing scanners mean less
  coverage, so say exactly which categories went unscanned.
- Read every report in `REPORT_DIR`. For each scanner finding decide: **reachable** and
  exploitable here, or a **false positive** (and why: dead code, test fixture, input never
  user-controlled). Never drop a finding without that reason.
- Dependency findings: check whether the vulnerable function is actually used, and give the
  fixed version.

## 3. Sweep by category

Go through the code against each group. Use the map from step 1 to know where to look.

| Group | Look for |
|---|---|
| **Access control** (A01, CWE-862/863/639) | routes missing auth; records fetched by ID without an owner check (IDOR); role checks only on the client; privilege escalation through mass assignment; SSRF (user-controlled URLs fetched by the server); path traversal (CWE-22) |
| **Injection** (A05, CWE-79/89/78/94/77) | SQL built from strings; command execution with user input; template, LDAP, NoSQL and header injection; XSS (unescaped output, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `v-html`); log injection |
| **Authentication & sessions** (A07) | weak or missing password hashing (use argon2/bcrypt/scrypt); JWT `alg` confusion, missing expiry or signature checks; session fixation; tokens in URLs or logs; missing rate limits on login, reset and OTP |
| **Cryptography & secrets** (A04, CWE-798) | hardcoded credentials; weak algorithms (MD5/SHA1 for passwords, ECB, static IVs); `Math.random()` for tokens; TLS verification turned off; secrets in the client bundle or in public env vars |
| **Insecure design & business logic** (A06) | money as floats; negative or zero amounts and quantities; steps of a flow that can be skipped or replayed; coupons and limits applied twice; trust in client-sent prices, totals or roles |
| **Concurrency & integrity** (CWE-362/367) | read-then-write races on balances, stock and quotas (double spend); missing unique constraints; non-idempotent webhooks or payments; TOCTOU on files |
| **Input & resource handling** (A10, CWE-20/400/770/1333) | unbounded body, upload, page size or recursion; regexes vulnerable to ReDoS; zip and XML bombs (XXE, CWE-611); unsafe deserialization (CWE-502); unrestricted upload types (CWE-434) |
| **Errors & logging** (A09, A10) | stack traces or internals in responses; failing open (an exception leading to "allowed"); swallowed errors on security checks; PII or tokens in logs; no audit trail for sensitive actions |
| **Configuration** (A02) | CORS `*` with credentials; missing security headers; CSRF (CWE-352) on cookie-authenticated state changes; debug mode or default credentials; public buckets; overly broad IAM; containers running as root |
| **Supply chain & CI** (A03, A08) | unpinned actions; `pull_request_target` running untrusted code; secrets exposed to forks; script injection via `${{ github.event.* }}`; install scripts and typosquatted packages; lockfiles not committed |
| **AI features** (if any) | prompt injection reaching tools, actions or data; model output rendered as HTML or run as code; secrets or PII sent in prompts |

In `deep` mode, start one read-only subagent per group, in parallel, each given the attack
surface map and its group's checklist. Then merge their findings and remove duplicates.

## 4. Logic bugs

Run `/code-review high` on the current branch, or on the most recent changes in `full` mode. It
catches correctness bugs that become outages: wrong conditions, unhandled errors, broken edge
cases. On a branch with changes, also run `/security-review`.

## 5. Verify every high and critical finding

For each one, try to **disprove** it: find the middleware, validation, constraint or framework
default that already stops it. In `deep` mode a fresh subagent does this without seeing your
reasoning. Keep a finding only if the exploit path survives. Mark it `confirmed`, or
`plausible` (the path exists but depends on deployment or config you can't see).

## 6. Report

Write `REPORT_DIR/report.md`, which stays inside `.git` and is never committed. Then show the
summary to the user:

- one line on overall risk, then the counts by severity;
- a table with severity, category, `file:line` and a one-line title;
- for each finding, most severe first:
  - **What:** the code and why it's exploitable;
  - **Exploit:** concrete steps or a request;
  - **Impact:** what an attacker gets;
  - **Fix:** the change;
  - **Test:** the regression test that proves the fix;
- coverage: which scanners ran, which were missing, and what was out of scope.

Severity: **critical** = remote, unauthenticated, data or money at stake; **high** = an
authenticated user can harm others, or one step from critical; **medium** = needs unusual
conditions; **low** = hardening.

## 7. Track and fix, without disclosing

- **Private repository:** offer one issue per confirmed critical or high finding, labelled
  `security` and with no exploit details in the title. Each one is then fixed through the normal
  flow (`/speckit-implement` or a small task), always with its regression test.
- **Public repository:** never open public issues for vulnerabilities. Offer a private draft
  security advisory instead, or keep the report local. First look for one with the same summary:
  ```bash
  gh api --paginate "repos/{owner}/{repo}/security-advisories?per_page=100" \
    --jq '.[] | select(.summary == "<summary>") | .html_url'
  ```
  If it prints a link, show that link and stop: the advisory already exists. Otherwise send the
  JSON body GitHub accepts (`severity` is `critical`, `high`, `medium` or `low`; `ecosystem` is the
  package's registry, such as `npm` or `pip`, or `other` when none fits):
  ```bash
  gh api -X POST "repos/{owner}/{repo}/security-advisories" --input - <<'EOF'
  {
    "summary": "<one line, no exploit detail>",
    "description": "<what is affected, the impact and the fix>",
    "severity": "high",
    "vulnerabilities": [{ "package": { "ecosystem": "other", "name": "<package>" } }]
  }
  EOF
  ```
- **A real secret was found:** say first that it must be **rotated** now, because removing it
  from git does not un-leak it. Then help remove it from the code.
- Offer to fix the lower-severity items as one hardening task.
