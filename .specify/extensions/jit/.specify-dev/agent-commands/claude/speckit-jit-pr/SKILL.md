# Task pull request (after `/speckit-implement`)

1. Read the level: `level:` in `.specify/extensions/jit/jit-config.yml` (default `standard`).
   - **lite**: ask "Review and open the PR now?" and continue only on yes.
   - **standard** and **full**: continue.
2. **Checks.** Run the constitution's test command, plus lint and build if they exist. If
   anything fails, stop and report it. Never open a PR on red checks: `pr.sh` (step 6) runs the
   test command again before the push and refuses the PR, with its last 20 lines, when it fails.

   **Tests are evidence, not decoration.** Each test comes from the task's *Completed when* and
   the spec's acceptance scenarios, and must fail if the behavior breaks:
   - assert exact values, both sides of every limit (the last allowed value and the first
     refused one), the error paths, and that nothing extra leaks out;
   - when a test fails, fix the code. Never loosen an assertion, add a retry or a skip, widen
     an accepted value ("200 or 405"), or delete the test to get green;
   - if an existing test really must change (the spec changed, or the test was wrong), the PR
     body needs a `## Test changes` section saying why. The script refuses the PR without it.

   Mutation testing runs once the commits are final: see the end of step 4.
3. **Commit.** Commit the task's changes, and only those. Stage files by name, never
   `git add -A`. Use a Conventional Commit message, `<type>(<scope>): <summary>`, with a body line
   `Refs #<ISSUE>`. Attribution lines (`Co-Authored-By` for Claude, "Generated with") follow the
   project's `.claude/settings.json`: with jit-speckit's default `"attribution"` block there are
   none; if the team removed that block to disclose AI use, keep them. The git pre-commit hook checks for secrets. If it refuses, remove the secret;
   never use `--no-verify`.
4. **Independent review**, the gate that catches what this session cannot see about its own
   work. Launch the reviewer exactly as `commands/review.md` (`/speckit-jit-review`) says: one
   `jit-speckit:reviewer` subagent, with `model` as review.md says, given that file and the facts it lists, and nothing of what you
   think about the code. While it runs, run `/security-review` on the branch.

   Save the report as it came to a file outside the repository (`mktemp`) and record it:
   `bash .specify/extensions/jit/scripts/review.sh record <file>`. Then fix every **High** and
   **Medium** finding in the code (a test changes only when the test was wrong: then
   `## Test changes`, step 2). Commit the fixes (same rules), re-run step 2, and check them with a
   **delta**: pass the reviewer the `REVIEWED=` sha and the last report, and record it with
   `review.sh record --delta <file>`. It reviews the fixes only, so it ends: a real bug in a fix
   gets one more delta, and a bug it notices elsewhere goes in `## Review` or a follow-up issue. When
   `record --delta` refuses (the fix grew, or the branch was rebased), run a new full review instead.
   A first review that says `ready` needs no second round. **Low** findings and test gaps are
   fixed or listed in `## Review`; they never hold the PR. This step runs at **every level**: the
   script in step 6 refuses a PR without a recorded `ready` review for the exact diff, so a
   commit after the review means one more review.

   **After the last commit** (the review's fix rounds included), run what is recorded for the
   exact diff; any later commit means running it again:
   - **Mutation testing proves the tests can fail.** Run
     `bash .specify/extensions/jit/scripts/mutants.sh` (the constitution's `mutate` command on
     this branch's changes). `ok` goes in *Evidence*. `survivors` means a behavior no test checks:
     for each surviving mutant in the changed lines, add the test that kills it (then commit and
     run it again), or write one line in *Evidence* naming the survivor and why it changes nothing
     observable (log or help text). `missing` means the constitution has no `mutate` command: say
     so in *Evidence* and suggest `/jit-speckit:adopt`. With a `mutate` command, the script in
     step 6 refuses a PR without a `mutants.sh` result for this diff, and refuses `survivors` when
     *Evidence* says nothing about them; without one, it adds "Mutation testing: not run" to the
     body.
   - **The scanners on the changed files.** Run
     `bash .specify/extensions/jit/scripts/security-scan.sh --changed` (it also scans uncommitted
     files, so after the last commit). Read every finding and fix the real ones (then commit and
     run it again). List the false positives with the reason, and any `missing` scanner. The
     script in step 6 refuses a PR without a scan for this diff; findings and `missing` scanners
     do not refuse, they go in the body.
5. **PR body**, written to a temporary file. Keep it short to read: what a reviewer needs is
   visible, the rest folds away.
   - one or two sentences on what changed;
   - `## Review`: your summary of the review, the only place it reaches the PR: what changed, each
     High and Medium finding and the commit that fixed it, the Low ones left with their reason, and
     the final assessment. A security finding is one line, `Security: reported privately (<id>)`,
     and nothing more: no file, no scenario. The script refuses a body without this section, at
     every level, and adds only what it can verify in a folded "Independent review" block: that a
     review was recorded for this diff (its patch id), its `Assessment:` line, the model it ran on
     and any warning about it, and the risk map as paths only (`Risk map (round 1)` and, after a
     delta, `Risk map (fix round)`). It never copies the report's text;
   - `## Evidence`: one visible line per result (e.g. "tests 42/42 · lint clean · scanners: no
     findings"), showing the task's *Completed when* is met. On **full** the script refuses a body
     without this section.
   - anything long (check output, scan details, false positives with their reason, screenshots)
     goes in a collapsible block, one per topic:
     `<details>` / `<summary>Test output</summary>` / blank line / the content / `</details>`;
   - attribution lines only if the project's settings ask for them (see step 3).
6. Run `bash .specify/extensions/jit/scripts/pr.sh task <TASK_ID> "<commit title>" <body-file>`.
   It pushes (the pre-push hook re-checks every commit for secrets), adds `Closes #<ISSUE>` and
   prints `PR=<url>`, and asks GitHub Copilot code review for a second independent read: it prints
   `copilot: code review requested` only when GitHub lists Copilot as a reviewer, and
   `copilot: not requested (GitHub did not add the reviewer)` otherwise. The `Security` and `CI` workflows then run on the PR; they are the gate.
7. End with the PR URL.
