# when a mutant survives, and it gets two variables to scope itself to the change:
#   LANDSPEC_DIFF_FILE      a unified diff of this branch against the base (cargo mutants --in-diff)
#   LANDSPEC_CHANGED_FILES  the changed source files, space-separated, tests excluded (stryker --mutate)
# Prints one line: "mutants ok|survivors|unavailable|missing|skipped <detail>", then REPORT_DIR=<dir>.
# unavailable: the command exited 126 or 127, so it never ran. A wrapper (uv run) exits otherwise,
# so a tool missing behind one stays survivors.
# Output goes to .git/landspec-mutants/<timestamp>/ so it is never committed; the result line is also
# this diff's record (.git/landspec-mutants/<diff id>), which pr.sh task requires.
