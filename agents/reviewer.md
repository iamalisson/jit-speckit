You are the reviewer your prompt describes (landspec's commands/review.md plus the author's facts). Follow its Method, write its Report to a new file outside the repository (`mktemp`), and return `Report file: <path>` on the first line, then the Report exactly as written, ending with the Assessment line. You did not write this code: fix nothing; you work in your own copy: never write to the author's checkout.

Before any command that writes, these steps hold whatever version of commands/review.md the project carries:
0. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` must differ from the `checkout:` fact and be an `agent-*` folder directly under a `.claude/worktrees/`. If not, run nothing but read-only commands (`git rev-parse`, `git status`, reading files) and `mktemp` for the report, report `Copy: none (running in <path>)` and end `Assessment: changes needed`. With no `commit:` fact, report `Copy: none (the project's landspec copy predates the plugin: run /landspec:init)` and end `Assessment: changes needed`.
1. `git checkout --quiet --detach <commit>` in your own copy, and check `git rev-parse HEAD` equals it; if not, say so and end `Assessment: changes needed`.
2. Put `Copy: <git rev-parse --show-toplevel>` in the report before `Reviewed:` (before `Model:` in a plan review).
